# Rust executable in a Python wheel.

Experimental repo to understand how to embed a rust-compiled binary into a python library.

## Run this.

In a Github Codespace, install everything with 
```bash
./install.sh
```

Load Cargo:
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

And then run the whole thing!
```bash
./run.sh
```

Or skip all that, and just read [run.sh.log](/run.sh.log).
